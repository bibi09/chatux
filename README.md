Chatux
======

Chatux is a chat terminal application available on UNIX systems. It uses NCURSES to render the CLI.


Requirements
------------
Chatux needs at least a C++98 compiler and the ncurses library as dependency.


Compilation
-----------
To compile the application, just run the make command into the "src" directory.
Avoid the "-j" option. It compiles fast so don't worry...

Execution
---------
Run the bash script "run_chatux.sh" after compiling it. It is an easy way to configure a chat server/client instance.
